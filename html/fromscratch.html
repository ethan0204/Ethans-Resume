    <h1 id="top">My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <p>I like a lot of different things.  However, I do have one hobby that I like more than all the others: playing wargames.  My favorite is a game called Warhammer, and I would like to talk a bit about what this game is and why I enjoy it.</p>
    <p>This is a hobby with a lot of different stages besides just playing a game, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#collect">Collecting and Assembling</a></li>
      <li><a href="#paint">Painting</a></li>
      <li><a href="#army">Creating an Army</a></li>
      <li><a href="#play">Playing the Game</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>In this page I will review each stage of this hobby and why I love it and think it is a great way to express creativity, challenge your mind, and practice fine motor skills.</p>

    <section id="collect">
      <h2>Collecting and Assembling</h2>
      <p>The first part of playing Warhammer is choosing and collecting your army. There are dozens of armies to choose from, with each having their own unique lore, playstyle, and miniatures. This can be a complex process, where you must make your decision based on:</p>
       <ul>
           <li class="bold">What models you like the look of</li>
           <li class="bold">What lore you find interesting</li>
           <li class="bold">What playstyle you prefer</li>
           <li class="bold">What models are available to you</li>
           <li class="bold">What models you can afford</li>
       </ul>
       <p> One last thing to consider for those who want to focus less on the building and collecting and more on the game itself is the competitive viability of each faction. This is a living game that is constantly balanced and changed, with updates happening roughly monthly. Below is a current graph showing the win rates for each faction from the most recent play data.</p>

      <p>Note that this constantly changes, so picking an army based on their competitive viability is not a good idea as generally the rules will have shifted by the time you are able to make a full army capable of playing the game. Once you have purchased some models, we can get into the assembly portion of the game</p>
      <br>
      <p>Assembly involves several steps, including:</p>
      <ol>
          <li class="bold">Cleaning the models
                <p class="normal">Models come in a plastic mold referred to as "sprues". In order to get the models ready for assembly, you must:</p>
                <img src="../images/sprue.jpg" alt="Plastic Sprue with models" width="300px" class="image-right">
                <ul class="normal">
                     <li>Cut the models free using a sharp hobby knife or clippers</li>
                     <li>Shave off the remnants of the sprue connections using a sharp hobby knife</li>
                     <li>Use the back of your knife to remove the mold lines and any other imperfections, leaving a smooth surface across the model</li>
                </ul>
               <p class="normal">Once this is done, we can move onto the next step.</p> 
          </li>
          <li class="bold">Assembling the models
                <p class="normal">Models are assembled using a strong plastic glue that melts the plastic together. This is a very simple process, where you:</p>
                <ul class="normal">
                     <li>Apply a small amount of glue to the pieces you want to connect</li>
                     <li>Press the pieces together and hold for a few seconds</li>
                     <li>Repeat until the model is fully assembled</li>
                </ul>
               <p class="normal">Once this is done, we can move onto the final step of assembly</p>
          </li>
          <li class="bold">Priming the models
               <p class="normal">Priming is an essential step in preparing your models for painting. It involves applying a base coat of primer to the model to help the paint adhere better. This is done using:</p>
               <ul class="normal">
                   <li>Acrylic spray primer for a smooth, even coat</li>
                   <li>Brush-on primer for more control and detail work</li>
               </ul>
               <p class="normal">Once the primer is dry, your models should look like the one shown here and they are ready for painting!</p>

      <h2>Painting</h2>

This includes:</p>

          <li>High-quality acrylic paints (Make sure they are acrylic paints!! Other paints won't stick correctly)</li>
          <li>Fine detail brushes</li>
          <li>Palette for mixing colors</li>
          <li>Water cup for rinsing brushes</li>

          <li class="bold">Choosing a Warlord and their associated traits
            <p class="normal">A Warlord is a special unit that leads your army and has unique abilities. You must choose a Warlord that fits your playstyle and complements your army.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="bold">Deciding which equipment to Use
